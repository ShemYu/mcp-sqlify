# Development Principles & Practices

This document outlines key principles and practices for effective software development, particularly relevant when collaborating with AI assistants like Cascade, but valuable for all development scenarios.

1.  **Clear Goal & Planning:**
    *   Start with a well-defined project goal.
    *   Break down the goal into distinct phases and actionable tasks (e.g., documented in `README.md`).
    *   Flexibly adapt and refine the plan as needed.

2.  **Step-by-Step Execution:**
    *   Decompose larger tasks into smaller, manageable steps.
    *   Execute tasks sequentially, building upon previous results.

3.  **Iterative Development & Debugging:**
    *   When encountering issues, actively analyze the root cause.
    *   Discuss and evaluate potential solutions.
    *   Implement fixes or improvements iteratively and re-test.
    *   Make informed decisions on the next steps based on results.

4.  **Embrace Refactoring:**
    *   Recognize refactoring as crucial for maintaining code quality, readability, and maintainability.
    *   **Don't hesitate to refactor.** With AI assistance, large-scale changes are often faster. Continuously review and improve the architecture, even if it means modifying AI-generated code.
    *   Prioritize long-term design over short-term implementation ease.

5.  **Verification & Testing:**
    *   **Test all code rigorously**, regardless of whether it was written by a human or an AI.
    *   Utilize various testing methods (unit tests, integration tests, evaluation scripts) to ensure correctness.
    *   Practice **incremental verification**: test small pieces of functionality as they are completed to catch errors early.

6.  **Importance of Documentation & Structure:**
    *   Maintain a clear project structure.
    *   Write meaningful comments and documentation (like `README.md`, docstrings).
    *   Good structure and documentation benefit human understanding *and* help AI assistants provide more relevant and accurate help.

7.  **Transparency & Explanation (Especially with AI):**
    *   AI assistants should explain their actions and reasoning.
    *   Humans should clearly state their intent and goals.

By adhering to these principles, development teams (including human-AI partnerships) can build robust, maintainable software more effectively.
